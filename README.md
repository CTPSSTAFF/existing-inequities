# Identifying Transportation Inequities in the Boston Region
This repository contains data and mehtodology to support a UPWP project analyzing existing inequities within the Boston Region MPO.
## Purpose
The purpose of this study is to develop a baseline assessment of existing transportation inequities in the Boston region. While the equity policies applied by the MPO and other transportation agencies often take the status quo as a given and attempt to prevent making inequities worse through future investments, this study will take a historical perspective and attempt to identify existing inequities that have been caused by past decisions and identify opportunities for the MPO to reduce the divergent outcomes between population groups.
