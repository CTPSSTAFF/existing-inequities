Colleges and universities.
Zipped shapefile: “Colleges_MA_2018.zip”
To do:
On the spreadsheet “College_enrollment_commuter 2020-21 AY USE”, there is a column called NCES_ID. Several universities have multiple entries, identifiable by the NCES_ID “xxxxxx-x”. In the shapefile, edit the NCES_ID values for these entries so that they match those in the spreadsheet.
Join the shapefile to the spreadsheet “College_enrollment_commuter 2020-21 AY USE” on the field NCES_ID.
Remove any values that do not join (they are not in the MPO region or are not major commuter schools). Now the enrollment data are attached to the shapefile.
