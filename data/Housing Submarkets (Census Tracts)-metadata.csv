descriptn,Description,MAPC's Housing Submarket Typology classifies each census tract in the MAPC region into one of seven housing submarkets. The census tracts have been clustered into submarkets using a latent profile analysis. This dataset includes variables used in the LPA (tagged with "LPA variable") and variables MAPC has overlaid on the submarkets to understand the people, history, conditions, and opportunities within each submarket (tagged with "Overlay variable").
