Created ArcGISPro project with geocoder. Ran on the clinic and pharmacy address files.

Future work:
Figure out how to use python for the geocoding process using a locator file.
https://developers.arcgis.com/python/guide/part4-batch-geocoding/
And/or integrate with R and reticulate.

Or vet the accuracy of tidygeocoder and the default arcgis api integration.
