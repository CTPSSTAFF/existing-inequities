datafolder <- "data/Access to healthcare"

# Note: name of file is based on location of space in the file name

# STEP 2: Prep addresses for geocoding #### 
# Prep non-spatial data for geocoding
# Tidygeocoder has a methods argument, 
# Tried using Open Street Map's Nominatim, but results were not as clean as method = "arcgis"
# When method = "arcgis" results are analogous to running addresses through ArcGIS geoproccessing
# https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidygeocoder/readme/README.html

# address_cl <- `licensed-clinic-services-february-2022` %>% 
#   select(name= `Clinic Name`, addr_st = Street, town= `City/Town`, zip = `Zip Code`) %>%

#   select(name, address) %>% 
#   mutate(type= "Licensed Clinic")
# write_csv(address_cl, "geocoding/clinics_addresses.csv")

#   geocode(address, method= 'arcgis', lat = latitude , long = longitude) %>% 
#   st_as_sf(coords= c("longitude", "latitude"), crs=4326 )

# Geocoded using MassGIS Locator file in ArcGIS Pro

  select(name = USER_name, address = USER_address, type= USER_type) %>%

# using that point instead of geocoding

  st_transform(4326) %>% 
  mutate(type= "Community Health Center")
rm(CommunityHealthCenters_Oct2019)
# STEP 4: Find duplicate healthcare opportunities ####
# for the clinics and community health centers there is some overlap between layers. 
# Compare the layers to make sure that the same clinic or CHC isnâ€™t being counted twice, and if it is, 
# remove the offending record from one point layer. Note - hospitals often have complexes with clinics 
# or CHCs or pharmacies, these do not need to be removed.

dup_ch_cl <- find_potential_duplicate_points2(pt_ch, pt_cl)
dup_ch_cl <- dup_ch_cl %>% 
  # inspect and clean up so that all potential duplicates actually appear to be distinct opportunities

# if there is an id or an FID (default saving with shp driver) then that id becomes the weight and throws off access opportunity counts
